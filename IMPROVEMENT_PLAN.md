## 🧪 Testing Requirements & Standards

### **Mandatory Testing Rules**
1. **No feature ships without tests** - Every new component, function, or feature must include:
   - Unit tests (minimum 80% coverage)
   - Integration tests (where applicable)
   - E2E tests (for user-facing features)
   - Accessibility tests (for UI components)

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Write tests before implementation:
   ```typescript
   // 1. Write failing test
   it('should calculate user age correctly', () => {
     expect(calculateAge('1990-01-01')).toBe(34);
   });
   
   // 2. Implement feature
   // 3. Ensure test passes
   ```

3. **Coverage Thresholds** - CI will fail if coverage drops below:
   - Unit tests: 80%
   - E2E tests: 70% 
   - Component tests: 90%

4. **Test Types Required**:
   - **Unit Tests**: All functions, components, utilities
   - **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database operations
   - **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
   - **Visual Regression Tests**: UI components
   - **Accessibility Tests**: All interactive elements
   - **Performance Tests**: Page load times, bundle sizes

### **Pre-Merge Checklist**
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Test coverage meets thresholds
- [ ] New features include comprehensive tests
- [ ] Existing tests updated for changes
- [ ] E2E tests cover user workflows
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass
- [ ] Performance tests show no regressions
