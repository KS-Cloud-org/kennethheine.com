🛠 Step 1: Define Your Niche and Unique Angle
✔ What do you do?
I help software developers and DevOps engineers use AI and automation to streamline development workflows — by applying tools like GitHub Copilot, GPT APIs, CI/CD automation, and smart integrations that save time and improve software quality.

✔ Who is your audience?
My audience includes junior and senior developers, DevOps professionals, and tech teams who want practical, hands-on AI and automation guidance — not just theoretical knowledge, but clear, actionable steps that work in real projects. They are tech-savvy but often feel overwhelmed by the rapid flood of AI tools and need clarity on what truly adds value.

✔ What is your unique angle?
I combine real-world DevOps experience with the latest AI tools. I don’t just teach what these tools do — I show how to integrate them directly into existing development and deployment processes. My strength is making complex, cutting-edge technology simple and usable in day-to-day work.

✔ Your niche statement (one-liner):

“I help developers and DevOps teams work smarter, not harder — by teaching them how to use AI and automation to code faster, deploy faster, and deliver better software.”
