🛠 Step 1 (Updated): Define Your Niche and Unique Angle
✔ What do you do?
I help software developers, DevOps engineers, and tech teams use AI and automation to streamline development workflows — combined with expertise in Azure cloud architecture and application architecture, ensuring that solutions are scalable, robust, and well-integrated across the tech stack.

✔ Who is your audience?
My audience includes junior and senior developers, DevOps professionals, software architects, and tech leads who want practical, hands-on guidance on how to combine AI tools with modern cloud practices. They are technically skilled but often need a clear path on how to apply new AI-driven approaches within cloud-native systems, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable app designs.

✔ What is your unique angle?
I combine real-world DevOps and software architecture experience with the latest AI innovations. I don’t just teach how tools work — I show how to embed them in the bigger context of cloud infrastructure, application design, and continuous delivery systems (especially in Azure). My strength is making cutting-edge technologies practical, scalable, and aligned with real-world architectures.
