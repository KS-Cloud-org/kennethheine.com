You are a senior full-stack engineer.

**Goal**  
Build a modern, fully **static** personal-brand website with four routes:

1. `/` – Home (hero banner, tagline, profile photo, CTA buttons)  
2. `/about` – About Me (short bio, skills grid, timeline or milestones)  
3. `/blog` – Blog index that reads local Markdown/MDX files from `/content/posts/*`.  
   Each post should be prerendered at `/blog/[slug]`.  
4. `/contact` – Simple placeholder page (headline + paragraph + `mailto:` link).  
   *No* form, *no* client-side validation, *no* JS required here.

**Tech stack**  
- **Next.js 14** with `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js` (static HTML in `out/`)  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS (dark + light themes)  
- `next-seo` for meta tags  
- MDX via `next-mdx-remote` for blog posts  
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests  
- Absolutely **no** serverless functions or API routes.

**Design & accessibility**  
- Clean, minimalist look, generous whitespace  
- Fluid headline sizes; body ≈ 1 rem  
- Use Tailwind `prose` classes for blog content  
- Accessible colour contrast, focus outlines, `alt` text everywhere  
- Mobile-first: stacks nicely on < 640 px screens

**Requirements**  
1. Generate the full project tree (`app/`, `components/`, `content/posts/`, etc.).  
2. Provide boilerplate code for every route with placeholder content.  
3. Add a sample Markdown post (`hello-world.mdx`) with front-matter (`title`, `date`, `summary`, `tags`).  
4. Create a shared `Layout.tsx` (header, footer, dark-mode toggle); header highlights the active route.  
5. Tailwind config with a custom `brand` palette and fonts.  
6. `/contact` page must contain *only* static placeholder text—no form elements.  
7. Unit tests for the blog list (titles & dates render correctly).  
8. `README.md` covering local development (`pnpm dev`) and static export (`pnpm build && pnpm export`).  
9. Comment every file so a beginner can follow along.  
10. **Output files one at a time** in clearly delimited code blocks, e.g.  
    ```
// --- file: next.config.mjs ---
    ```  
    Continue until the entire scaffold (code + tests + docs) is complete.

Stop when finished.
