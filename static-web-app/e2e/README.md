## Best Practices

1. **Use fast tests for development** - Get quick feedback on your changes
2. **Run full suite before releases** - Ensure compatibility across all target browsers
3. **Check reports after test runs** - Review any failures or performance issues
4. **Use headed mode for debugging** - See what's happening in the browser
5. **Use UI mode for test development** - Interactive test creation and debugging
