- ✅ Added implementation details for each completed task
- ✅ Documented the MCP, Copilot Chat, and Coding Agent configurations

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd static-web-app

# Scan for untested components
npm run test:scan

# Generate a test file for a specific component
npm run test:generate components/ui/NewComponent.tsx

# Get help with test generation
npm run test:help

# Run all tests to validate setup
npm test

# Build to ensure everything works
npm run build
```

### Using GitHub Copilot Chat
1. Open VS Code with the repository
2. Access Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I)
3. Use templates from `.vscode/copilot-chat-config.md`
4. Examples:
   ```
   @copilot /tests generate comprehensive test file for Button component with accessibility testing
   @copilot /plan create testing strategy for blog search functionality
   @copilot /debug help troubleshoot Jest test failure with async state updates
   ```

### Using Test Generation Script
```bash
# Generate test template (then use Copilot to complete TODOs)
node scripts/test-generation.js generate components/ui/Button.tsx

# Find components that need tests
node scripts/test-generation.js scan

# Show help and usage examples
node scripts/test-generation.js help
```

### Environment Validation
```bash
# Run the GitHub Actions workflow locally (individual steps)
# Check Copilot configuration
grep -q "github.copilot.enable" .vscode/settings.json && echo "✅ Copilot enabled"

# Check MCP configuration
[ -f ".vscode/mcp-config.json" ] && echo "✅ MCP configured"

# Validate test environment
cd static-web-app && npm test
```
