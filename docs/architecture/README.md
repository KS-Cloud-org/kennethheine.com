# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the kennethheine.com project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the project lifecycle.

## üìã What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are lightweight documentation that captures important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help maintain institutional knowledge and provide transparency in decision-making.

## üìÅ Structure

Each ADR follows a consistent format:
- **Context**: The situation that requires a decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The outcomes (positive, negative, and neutral)
- **Alternatives**: Other options that were considered
- **Status**: Current state of the decision

## üî¢ Numbering Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially starting from 0001:
- `0001-nextjs-framework.md`
- `0002-azure-static-web-apps.md`
- `0003-bicep-infrastructure.md`
- etc.

## üìù Creating New ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- Technology choices (frameworks, libraries, platforms)
- Architecture patterns and approaches
- Infrastructure and deployment strategies
- Development workflows and processes
- Security and compliance approaches

### Process

1. **Copy the template**: Use [adr-template.md](./adr-template.md) as your starting point
2. **Number sequentially**: Use the next available number (check existing ADRs)
3. **Use descriptive titles**: Keep titles brief but descriptive (e.g., "Use Next.js 14 for Frontend Framework")
4. **Fill out all sections**: Don't skip sections, even if they seem minimal
5. **Get review**: Have the ADR reviewed by relevant team members
6. **Update status**: Mark as "Accepted" once finalized

### Naming Convention

Files should be named: `{number}-{kebab-case-title}.md`

Examples:
- `0001-nextjs-framework.md`
- `0002-azure-static-web-apps.md`
- `0003-bicep-infrastructure.md`

## üìä ADR Status Types

- **Proposed**: Under consideration, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and is active
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (link to the new ADR)

## üìö Current ADRs

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [0001](./0001-nextjs-framework.md) | Use Next.js 14 for Frontend Framework | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |
| [0002](./0002-azure-static-web-apps.md) | Use Azure Static Web Apps for Hosting | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |
| [0003](./0003-bicep-infrastructure.md) | Use Bicep for Infrastructure as Code | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |
| [0004](./0004-github-actions-cicd.md) | Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD | Accepted | 2025-01-08 |
