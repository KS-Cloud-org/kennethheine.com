gh issue create --title "Set up Husky for pre-commit hooks" --body "## 📋 Task Overview

**Issue ID:** #003  
**Phase:** 0 - Foundation Setup  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** 2 hours  
**Dependencies:** Prettier/ESLint setup (#002) ✅ Complete  

## 🎯 Description

Set up Husky pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality standards are enforced automatically before commits are made to the repository. This will prevent low-quality code from entering the codebase and maintain consistent formatting and testing standards.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Install and configure Husky
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hook for linting
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hook for testing  
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hook for formatting
- [ ] Add commitlint for conventional commits
- [ ] Update progress tracker and phase documentation

## 🔧 Implementation Commands

\`\`\`bash
cd static-web-app
npm install --save-dev husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit \"npm run lint && npm test\"
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg \"npx --no -- commitlint --edit \$1\"
\`\`\`

## 📁 Files to Create/Modify

## 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Verify pre-commit hooks run on commit attempts
- [ ] Test that linting failures prevent commits
- [ ] Test that test failures prevent commits
- [ ] Verify commit message format validation works
- [ ] Ensure hooks can be bypassed when necessary (--no-verify)
