## 📚 Implementation Notes

### Content Security Policy
```json
{
  "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com;"
}
```

### Security Headers Configuration
```json
{
  "globalHeaders": {
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload",
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
    "Permissions-Policy": "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()"
  }
}
```

### Cookie Consent Implementation
```typescript
// Cookie consent component
export const CookieConsent = () => {
  const [showBanner, setShowBanner] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent');
    if (!consent) {
      setShowBanner(true);
    }
  }, []);

  const handleAccept = () => {
    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'accepted');
    setShowBanner(false);
    // Initialize analytics
  };

  const handleDecline = () => {
    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'declined');
    setShowBanner(false);
    // Disable analytics
  };

  return showBanner ? (
    <div className="cookie-banner">
      <p>We use cookies to improve your experience...</p>
      <button onClick={handleAccept}>Accept</button>
