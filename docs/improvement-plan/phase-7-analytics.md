## ❌ Tasks Removed (Not Suitable for Personal Website)

The following tasks from the original plan were removed as they are overkill for a personal website with small traffic:

- **E-commerce tracking** - Not applicable for personal blog/portfolio
- **A/B testing framework** - Insufficient traffic for statistical significance  
- **Heatmap tracking** - Expensive and privacy-invasive for minimal benefit
- **User session recording** - Privacy concerns and unnecessary complexity
- **Advanced user journey mapping** - Overkill for a 4-page website
- **Business intelligence reporting** - Not a business website
- **Conversion funnel tracking** - No clear conversion goals for personal site
- **Application Insights integration** - Basic monitoring sufficient
- **Automated reporting and alerts** - Manual monthly review more appropriate
- **Advanced event tracking** - Basic GA4 events sufficient

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Essential Analytics
- **Basic Traffic Insights:** Understanding visitor patterns and popular content
- **Performance Monitoring:** Core Web Vitals within acceptable ranges
- **SEO Performance:** Search visibility and organic traffic trends

### Content Strategy
- **Popular Content:** Identifying which blog posts resonate with readers

  getFID(sendToAnalytics);
  getFCP(sendToAnalytics);
  getLCP(sendToAnalytics);
