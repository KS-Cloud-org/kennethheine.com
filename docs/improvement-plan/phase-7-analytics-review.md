## üîç Key Changes Made

### Tasks Removed (10 tasks)

4. **User session recording** - Privacy concerns and unnecessary complexity
5. **Advanced user journey mapping** - Overkill for a 4-page website
6. **Business intelligence reporting** - Not a business website
7. **Conversion funnel tracking** - No clear conversion goals for personal site
8. **Application Insights integration** - Basic monitoring sufficient
9. **Automated reporting and alerts** - Manual monthly review more appropriate

### Tasks Simplified (5 tasks remaining)
1. **Basic GA4 setup** - Privacy-first, no consent management complexity
2. **Core Web Vitals monitoring** - Essential for SEO and UX
