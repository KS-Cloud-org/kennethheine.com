# Phase 3: Performance & SEO Optimization

## 📊 Status: In Progress
**Progress:** 5/6 tasks completed (83%)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 (Frontend Code Quality)  
**Estimated Timeline:** 3-4 days (revised for personal website scope)

## 🎯 Overview
Implement essential SEO fundamentals and basic performance optimizations appropriate for a personal website with small traffic. Focus on core SEO requirements rather than enterprise-level monitoring and analytics.

## 🔄 **REVISED FOR PERSONAL WEBSITE SCOPE**
This phase has been significantly streamlined to focus on essential SEO and performance improvements that provide meaningful value for a personal blog with small traffic. Enterprise-level optimizations have been removed or simplified.

**Key Changes:**
- ✂️ **Removed:** Complex performance monitoring, progressive loading, analytics dashboards
- 📉 **Simplified:** Image optimization (3 images only), structured data (basic schemas only)
- ⏰ **Time Reduced:** From 132 hours to 18 hours (86% reduction)
- 🎯 **Focus:** Essential SEO fundamentals that actually impact search rankings

## 📝 Tasks

### 3.1 Essential Performance Optimizations

#### Task: Basic Image Optimization
- **Issue:** [#042] Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Assignee:** Kenneth
- **Estimate:** 3 hours *(reduced from 8 hours)*
- **Dependencies:** Phase 2 completion
- **Priority:** High

**Current Image Analysis:**
